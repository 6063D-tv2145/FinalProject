# FinalProject
**1. Air Quality Monitor**
I have seen in many places, that there are CO2 monitors that can be purchased and used with Arduinos. I was thinking that it would be great to have this sensor collect input, and in processing, create an aesthetically pleasing visual, that is continuously updating with the data, and lets the user know when to open the windows, and in cases of very bad air quality, warn the user and give them resources on what to do to keep themselves safe.
Additionally, (this is quite a stretch), but I found this bird air quality sensor, in which the bird 'drops dead' when the air quality is bad. I thought to myself if something of a similar concept i.e. movement is initiated based on the air quality input, would be feasible using a servo motor (which I've seen used in several projects on the arduino project hub).
I do really like this idea, I am worried about the quality of the sensors though, and having the entire project rely on it. It would also be quite difficult to test. Alternatively, I could use this idea of movement via servo motor but not rely on the air quality monitor, but just focus on some sort of interaction that would create input in processing.

**2.Difficult Plant Tamagotchi**  
Inspired by the [Plant Communicator](https://projecthub.arduino.cc/Arduino_Genuino/plant-communicator-0ab3c8) I thought I could use a soil [moisture sensor](https://www.amazon.com/HiLetgo-Moisture-Automatic-Watering-Arduino/dp/B01DKISKLO/ref=sr_1_4?crid=1LFBH8EIGRMBI&keywords=moisture+sensor+arduino&qid=1701147020&sprefix=moisture+sensor+%2Caps%2C117&sr=8-4), to create input and feed it into a 'Tamagotchi' like interaction in processing. The thought behind this is that I inherited a lot of plants from someone who used to live in my apartment and there are a couple of plants that are difficult to take care of and I have killed some of them. The plant in processing could be named, and the conditions for when to alert the plant carer could be customizable, making it a good tool for plant sitters.

**3.Portrait of You(r eyes)?**  
Using the webcam to take a picture (of an eye maybe?), taking that image processing could rasterize it, and via an arduino, the size of the circles / colors could be generated. Additionally, a customization feature such as your name could also be taken as input, so the poster is as personal as possible. It could include name, date, time + eye graphic.

Inspiration was taken from our pixel processing class and these Pinterest posters:

**4.Typography poster**
This idea is the least fleshed out, but I was thinking I could use arduino input via a button or something similar, to change attributes of text on a poster. The text could potentially be also taken in as custom text (but would likely have a character limit), and interacting with the arduino could change color, letter placement, or maybe even something fun like make it collapse (see gravity poster).
